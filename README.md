## Check this out!
Below is a test route calculated by the A* algorithm.  The map is from OpenStreetMap and is 100m x 100m.  The start location is at location 20m x 80m, and the stop location is at 70m x 10m.

The coordinates 0m x 0m will be in the bottom left-hand corner.  The coordinates 100m x 100m will be on the top right-hand corner.

Check these guys out.  I had no idea they existed before I did this project.  Now I can add some of my Robot navigation code to this and have an AWESOME mobile platform.  Look out traffic ... here I come!
